//! JSON depth calculations on byte streams.
//!
//! Used for iterating over the document while keeping track of depth.
//! This is heavily optimized for skipping irrelevant parts of a JSON document.
//! For example, to quickly skip to the end of the currently opened object one can set the
//! depth to `1` and then advance until it reaches `0`.
//!
//! It also supports stopping and resuming with [`ResumeClassifierState`].
