Blazing fast JSONPath CLI tool powered by SIMD.

A usage guide is available at <https://v0ldek.github.io/rsonpath/>.

Usage: rq[EXE] [OPTIONS] <QUERY> [FILE_PATH]

Arguments:
  <QUERY>
          JSONPath query to run against the input JSON

  [FILE_PATH]
          Input JSON file to query.
          
          If neither file nor --json is specified, uses the standard input stream.

Options:
      --json <JSON>
          Inline input JSON to query

  -v, --verbose
          Include verbose debug information

  -c, --compile
          Only compile the query and output the automaton, do not run the engine.
          
          Cannot be used with FILE_PATH.

  -r, --result <RESULT>
          Result reporting mode

          Possible values:
          - count:   Return only the number of matches
          - indices: Return a list of all bytes at which a match occurred
          - nodes:   Returns the full text of the matched nodes
          
          [default: nodes]

      --force-input <FORCE_INPUT>
          Bypass automatic resolution of the input strategy and force a specific one.
          
          This is not recommended in general, since the app automatically picks a strategy that will
          result in best performance. It might be useful, however, if the automatic resolution picks
          a subpar strategy, or if it is known ahead of time that memory maps are not available and
          there is no need for the app to try to create one.

          Possible values:
          - mmap:     Use a memory map over a file
          - eager:    Eagerly load all the input into memory before running the query
          - buffered: Read the input in chunks with a buffer

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
