      For CLI bugs, please include the `rq` command ran and preferably the input JSON, and the output of the app.
      
      For library bugs, it's best to write a small, self-contained Rust program using `rsonpath` that results in the incorrect behavior.
      If that's not feasible, then please include a snippet containing relevant code.

      For `rq` use the value provided by `rq --version`.
      
      For the library, please tell us if you are compiling your code using `target-feature` style `rustc` flags.
      Those might have a big impact on parts of our implementation. If not, leave blank.
